In the landscape of China's tech giants, few figures are as pivotal as Wang Xing.
He is the founder of Meituan, the world's largest on-demand delivery platform.
But success didn't come easy.
His early career was marked by serial failures.
He watched his startups collapse, weeping over declining numbers, yet he never gave up.
In 2010, he launched Meituan.
It started with group buying but evolved into a super-app that reshaped urban life.
The logic was simple but powerful:
Connect hungry customers with local businesses through a vast army of riders.
Today, millions of riders in yellow jackets navigate the streets of China, becoming the veins of the city's logistics.
Wang Xing’s vision went beyond just food.
He wanted to build the "operating system for city life."
It became a lifeline.
When sick at home, the riders deliver medicine within minutes.
Traveling?
You can book hotels and flights instantly.
Meituan covers almost every aspect of daily life.
However, this efficiency comes at a cost.
The system is driven by a ruthless algorithm that calculates the shortest time for every delivery.
Riders are often trapped in the system.
To avoid fines for late deliveries, they are forced to race against the clock, ignoring traffic rules.
This "need for speed" has led to a surge in traffic accidents.
The convenience of the customer is sometimes built on the safety risks of the riders.
This sparked public outrage and protests.
Riders demanded better treatment, insurance, and more reasonable delivery times.
Wang Xing and Meituan faced immense pressure.
The public began to question: Is technology serving humanity, or enslaving it?
Wang Xing’s work has undeniably modernized China.
But his story serves as a global lesson.
True innovation isn't just about efficiency;
it's about balancing profit with social responsibility.
This is the challenge for Wang Xing, and for the future of tech.
